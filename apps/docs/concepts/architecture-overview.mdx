AgentView consists of two parts: **Server** and **Studio**. All the configuration is managed in code via `agentview.config.tsx` file.

Below is a simplified architecture diagram. Blue parts are done by you, white parts are done by AgentView:

## Server

**Server** is a backend part. It exposes the REST API called **AgentView API**. All the communication with the outer world goes through it.

Most important features of the API:
- create & access agent sessions
- orchestrate session status via runs (sessions can be in progress, completed, cancelled, failed, etc.)
- resume / retry runs
- push items to the session (input, output, reasoning, tool calls, etc.)
- streaming
- manage users - sessions are always connected with some user
- manage metadata - sessions, runs and items can have custom metadata

You can access the API directly, however it's recommended to use AgentView SDK: Typescript or Python. (TODO!!!)

There's a subset of AgentView API called **AgentView Public API** (or just **Public API**). It allows for direct access to the session data from the browser. It's limited and secure, AgentView takes care of the authentication and authorization.

For now, Server must be set up locally via `docker-compose.yml`, we'll ship Cloud version soon.

## Studio

The **Studio** is a powerful and collaborative data viewer for your agents.

It's a single page application built in React Router 7 and shipped as an `npm` package. Thanks to this architecture it's trivial to customise any part of the experience simply by providing custom React components in your codebase.

In our [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart) example Studio is a simple Vite app run in this way (see `studio/index.tsx`):

```ts
import "./styles.css";
import { renderStudio } from "agentview";
import agentviewConfig from "./agentview.config";

renderStudio(
    document.getElementById("agentview"), 
    agentviewConfig
);
```

Studio deliberalty doesn't rely on server runtime, it's pure client-side application. Thanks to this it's trivial to build it as a static site and just drop it onto any static hosting.

Here are some most important features of the Studio:

- collaborative - invite users, comment, get notifications on activity
- extremely customisable - provide custom components to any part of experience. It's shipped as a React package so that it's possible.
- test environment - users can test agent in AgentView
- private, shared, production sessions are separated
- add custom pages, make it a control panel of your agent

## Configuration

All the AgentView configuration is in `agentview.config.tsx` file. This file lives in Studio project and must be provided to Studio in `renderStudio(...)`.

All the agent definition information (mostly schemas) is sent to the AgentView Server. Thanks to this Server can do proper validation and prevent incorrect data getting into your system.

In order to make this connection work you set `server` property in `agentview.config.tsx` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    apiUrl: process.env.AGENTVIEW_API_URL,
    // ...
})
```

Now when you run `npm run dev` in your Studio project, each time `agentview.config.tsx` is changed, it's gonna be synchronised with the Server.

## Your Agent Endpoint

Any AI application must expose a HTTP endpoint that takes user input and generates AI responses. We call this endpoint "Agent Endpoint". Vercel AI SDK calls it "chat endpoint" (`/api/chat`).

In AgentView ecosystem you build and host Agent Endpoint yourself, in any language or framework you want. This gives you a total flexibility and doesn't lock you into any specific framework. As shown in [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart) example you can use AgentView SDK to read and write session data, users, runs, items, etc.
