title: "Spaces"
---

In the Studio sidebar you'll see links named `Production`, `Shared` or `Playground`. We call them **Spaces**.

The purpose of the Space is to separate users and sessions into different logical buckets:
1. **`production`** - the real-world production users & sessions
2. **`playground`** - "test" users & sessions created by team member in playground. Not visible for other team members.
3. **`shared-playground`** - same as `playground`, but visible for all team members.

As we explained in [Users](/concepts/users) chapter, each AgentView Session belongs to a User, and it's actually the User object that has a `space` property.

### Creating user in a specific space

Users are created explicitly with `av.createUser` or implicitly when you run `av.createSession` without passing `userId` parameter. Both functions can take `space` parameter:

```ts
// explicit user creation in `production` space
const user = await av.createUser({ space: "production" });

// implicit user creation in `shared-playground` space
const session = await av.createSession({ 
    agent: "my_agent", 
    space: "shared-playground"
});
```

### Defaults

AgentView comes with a default behaviour thanks to which you usually don't need to pass `space` parameter. It differs based on the API Key you use:

1. **Development API Key** - default space is `playground` belonging to the key's owner.
2. **Production API Key** - default space is `production`.

For security reasons, you can't create sessions in `production` space when you use Development API Key.
