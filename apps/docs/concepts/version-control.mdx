title: "Version Control"
---

As you update your agent over time, users may attempt to continue sessions that were created with a **previous** version of your agent. Maintaining compatibility between versions can be challenging, and sometimes it's better to prevent continuation rather than risk incompatibility. AgentView handles this scenario through versioning.

Each run in AgentView must have a version attached. Provide the current version of your agent using the `version` parameter in the `AgentView` constructor:

```ts
const av = new AgentView({
    agent: "my_agent",
    version: "0.1.1"
})
```

AgentView uses semantic versioning to determine compatibility. Sessions can only be continued with patch version increases (e.g., `0.2.5` → `0.2.6`). Minor or major version changes break compatibility and will prevent session continuation.

### Example

Consider a session where the first run was created with version `0.2.5`. If you upgrade your agent to version `0.2.6`, the session can be continued with a new run because patch version increases are considered backward-compatible according to semantic versioning. It's your responsibility to ensure that patch version updates maintain backward compatibility. Minor changes to the system prompt are a good example of a backward-compatible change that would warrant a patch version increase.

However, if the first run of your session was `0.2.5`, AgentView will throw an error if the next run has:
- A smaller patch version (e.g., `0.2.4`)
- A different minor version (e.g., `0.3.0`)
- A different major version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
