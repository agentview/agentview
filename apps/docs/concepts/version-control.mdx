title: "Version Control"
---

As you update your agent over time, users may attempt to continue sessions that were created with a **previous** version of your agent. Maintaining compatibility between versions can be challenging, and sometimes it's better to prevent continuation rather than risk incompatibility. AgentView handles this scenario through versioning.

Each run in AgentView **must** have a version attached.

```ts
const run = await av.createRun({
    items: [
        { type: "message", role: "user", content: "Hello, I'm Bob" },
    ],
    version: "0.1.1"
})
```

AgentView uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format) to determine compatibility. Sessions can be continued with patch or minor version increases (e.g., `0.2.5` → `0.2.6` or `0.2.5` → `0.3.0`), as these are considered backward-compatible according to semantic versioning. Major version changes break compatibility and will prevent session continuation.

### Example

Consider a session where the first run was created with version `0.2.5`. If you upgrade your agent to version `0.2.6` (patch) or `0.3.0` (minor), the session can be continued with a new run because patch and minor version increases are considered backward-compatible according to semantic versioning. It's your responsibility to ensure that patch and minor version updates maintain backward compatibility. Minor changes to the system prompt are a good example of a backward-compatible change that would warrant a patch version increase, while adding new optional features might warrant a minor version increase.

However, if the first run of your session was `0.2.5`, AgentView will throw an error if the next run has:
- A lower version (e.g., `0.2.4` or `0.1.0` - downgrades are not allowed)
- A different major version (e.g., `1.0.0` - major version changes break compatibility)
