## What is AgentView?

AgentView is a session viewer and backend for conversational agents.

It lets you write your AI logic in **any language or framework**. Most “AI frameworks” force you into their SDK or hosted backend. AgentView flips that model - it **wraps around** your AI, not inside it.

AgentView provides 2 parts:
1. Server - API for session management, storage, user authentication, versioning, and more.
2. Studio — a powerful session viewer focused on beautiful data presentation and collaboration (great for working with domain experts and business stakeholders). Ships as React package to provide maximum flexibility with **custom components anywhere**. 


### Own your AI

Agent View stays out of your AI logic. Most “AI frameworks” force you into their SDK or hosted backend. AgentView flips that model - it **wraps around** your AI, not inside it. It means you can write AI in Python, TS using any framework of your choice **or** without any framework at all. 

Here's how you could write your stateless endpoint with Hono and Responses API:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { AgentView } from "agentview";

const app = new Hono();
const client = new OpenAI()

const av = new AgentView({
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:1990",
  apiKey: "AGENTVIEW_PERSONAL_SECRET_KEY",
})

app.post('/chat', async (c) => {
  const { sessionId, endUserToken, input } = await c.req.json();

  const endUser = endUserToken ? await av.getEndUser({ token: endUserToken }) : await av.createEndUser();
  const session = sessionId ? await av.getSession({ id: sessionId, as: endUser }) : await av.createSession({ agent: "my_chat", as: endUser });

  const run = await av.createRun({
    sessionId: session.id,
    items: [input],
    version: "0.1.0",
  })

  c.req.raw.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
    av.updateRun({
      id: run.id,
      status: "cancelled",
    })
  })

  const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5-nano",
    instructions: "Be a nice agent.",
    input: [...session.history, input]
  });

  av.updateRun({
    id: run.id,
    items: [...response.output],
    status: "complete",
  })

  return c.json({
    sessionId: session.id,
    endUserToken: endUser.token,
    output: [...response.output]
  })
})
```
AgentView builds everything around your AI so you can focus on what matters.

```tsx
export default defineConfig({
    agents: [
        {
            name: "my_chat",
            url: "http://localhost:3000/agentview",
            run: {
                input: {
                    schema: z.looseObject({
                        type: z.literal("message"),
                        role: z.literal("user"),
                        content: z.string()
                    }),
                    displayComponent: ({ data }) => <UserMessage>{data.content}</UserMessage>
                    inputComponent: (props) => <UserMessagInput {...props} onSubmit={() => ...}/>
                },
                steps: [
                    {
                        schema: z.looseObject({
                            type: z.literal("reasoning"),
                            content: z.string()
                        }),
                        displayComponent: ({ data }) => <StepBlock>{data.content}</StepBlock>
                    }
                ]
                output: {
                    schema: z.looseObject({
                        type: z.literal("message"),
                        role: z.literal("assistant"),
                        content: z.string(),
                    }),
                    displayComponent: ({ data }) => <AssistantMessage>{data.content}</AssistantMessage>,
                }
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

### 🧩 Studio - a customisable data viewer

A powerful, collaborative interface for developing and debugging agents.

- view and debug conversations
- create test sessions easily, share with the team if needed
- comment collaboratively on agent outputs (Notion-style). Mentions, notifications.
- score outputs with teammates or domain experts
- manage users, permissions, and teams

AgentView Studio is not a cloud, fixed web app. It's a React package, where you provide your configuration with code. It makes it trivial to provide custom components for session views, custom messages, custom input forms, custom pages, whatever you need. However, it enforces certain design system to keep the Notion-like collaboration features working out-of-the-box.

### 💾 Server - storage & middleware

AgentView’s server takes care of all the glue you shouldn’t have to build yourself:

- conversation storage and retrieval
- clean, stateful APIs for integration
- session management, reconnections, and resumable long-running chats
- (soon) integrations with communication channels (email, Slack, WhatsApp, voice, etc.)
- (soon) human hand-offs — easily route a conversation to a person when needed

## Why? 

I've built conversational agents for several companies (mostly shopping assistants). While there are many SaaS products promising "AI agents," I found that custom-built agents tailored to specific business needs consistently outperform generic solutions. So I built agents with code.

But I quickly realized that building the AI logic is only a small part of the work. Building great data viewers, storage, and clean APIs often takes more time than the agent itself. It felt like being hired to build a website and ending up building a custom CMS.

The industry talks a lot about frameworks and workflow tools, but less about what matters most: **how you look at the data and distill it into improvements**. When building an agent for a skincare company, you're probably not a skincare expert—that's why engaging with stakeholders and domain experts is crucial. We need great tools for that collaboration.

That's why AgentView Studio prioritizes Notion-like simplicity for discussion and scoring, and why every journey—even the most custom one—can be tested in the Studio playground. Since scores, messages, and flows differ across projects, you can provide custom React components for every part of the system.
