title: "Why This Exists?"
description: "Why AgentView exists and what it's for"

I've built conversational agents for several companies (mostly shopping assistants). While there are many SaaS products promising "AI agents," I found that custom-built agents tailored to specific business needs consistently outperform generic solutions. So I built agents with code.

But I quickly realized that building the AI logic is only a small part of the work. Building great data viewers, storage, and clean APIs often takes more time than the agent itself. It felt like being hired to build a website and ending up building a custom CMS.

The industry talks a lot about frameworks and workflow tools, but less about what matters most: **how you look at the data and distill it into improvements**. When building an agent for a skincare company, you're probably not a skincare expert—that's why engaging with stakeholders and domain experts is crucial. We need great tools for that collaboration.

That's why AgentView Studio prioritizes Notion-like simplicity for discussion and scoring, and why every journey—even the most custom one—can be tested in the Studio playground. Since scores, messages, and flows differ across projects, you can provide custom React components for every part of the system.
