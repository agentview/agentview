You're building an agent. The AI part is fun — prompts, tools, RAG, evals. But then comes everything else:

- Where do sessions live?
- How do teammates view and debug them?
- How do stakeholders test without breaking production?
- Who manages users, auth, versioning, locking?

You've built this glue before. Maybe twice. It's boring and it's not why you got into AI.

**AgentView handles all of that.** You write a stateless function that generates responses. AgentView wraps it with sessions, persistence, a collaborative UI, and a production-ready API.

## What you keep

Your AI logic stays yours. Python or TypeScript. Any framework — Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain — or no framework at all. AgentView doesn't touch your prompts or model calls.

```typescript
// This is yours. AgentView doesn't care how it works.
async function generateResponse(history, input) {
  return await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [...history, input],
  });
}
```

## What AgentView adds

**Backend** — A stateful API that handles sessions, users, validation, locking, versioning, and streaming. You call it via TypeScript or Python SDK.

**Studio** — A customizable React app for viewing sessions, debugging, running playgrounds, and collaborating with your team. Comments, mentions, notifications — like Notion for your agent data.

Both are configured in code. No dashboards to click through.
