If you're building agents in code (support bots, shopping assistants, etc.), you're really doing two completely different jobs:

1. **The AI Engineering** – models, prompts, tools, RAG, memory, evals, monitoring, etc.
2. **Everything around it** – session storage, APIs, session viewer, playgrounds for stakeholders, user management, email/slack integrations, etc.

The first part is fun, but the second part can take a ridiculous amount of time. The goal of AgentView is to handle (2) so you can focus on (1).

**AgentView is completely framework-agnostic**. You write a stateless AI logic in Python or TypeScript, with any framework or none at all. The **AgentView API and SDK** provides a persistence layer that stores and orchestrates your session state, so you never have to build or maintain a complex backend.

AgentView also includes **Studio**: a visual interface for exploring and managing your agents. It's designed for ease of use by non-technical users, with built-in support for collaboration. Studio is **extremly customisable**, you can provide your custom components for any part of the experience.

#### Studio features

- **Browse and inspect real agent sessions**
- **Invite teammates; multi-user by default**
- **Comment, mention, and get notified (Notion-style)**
- **Use a realistic playground**: create private test sessions, share with stakeholders when ready
- **Customize deeply**: define how sessions, cards, inputs, and custom pages render by providing React components in a config file

#### Backend features

- **Store session data** in a simple, flexible array-based format
- **Validate data via schemas**
- **Manage session lifecycle via runs**
- **Track session versions** and prevent incompatible changes after agent updates
- **Expose a clean, stateful API** with streaming
- **Manage agent users and their sessions**
- **Expose a public, read-only API** that can be called directly from the browser
- **Communicate via TypeScript and Python SDKs**

All AgentView configuration lives in code.
