If you're building agents in code (support bots, shopping assistants, etc.), you're really doing two completely different jobs:

1. **The AI Engineering** – models, prompts, tools, RAG, memory, evals, monitoring, etc.
2. **Everything around it** – session storage, APIs, session viewer, playgrounds for stakeholders, user management, email/slack integrations, etc.

The goal of AgentView is to solve as much of (2) as possible without constraining how you build your AI logic.

(1) is fun to build. (2) is not. AgentView takes (2) off your plate — all the annoying glue and infra you probably don't want to maintain or rebuild every time.

### Stack-agnostic by design

Most AI frameworks force you into their hosted backend or they don't have one. AgentView flips that model – it wraps around your AI, not inside it.

You keep full control of the agent logic: write your stateless AI function in Python or TypeScript, using any framework (aisdk, agents-sdk, LangChain, your own) — or **no framework at all**. AgentView just connects to it and handles the sessions, state, and UI around it.


### Studio

- **Browse and inspect real agent sessions**
- **Invite teammates; multi-user by default**
- **Comment, mention, and get notified (Notion-style)**
- **Use a realistic playground**: create private test sessions, share with stakeholders when ready
- **Customize deeply**: define how sessions, cards, inputs, and custom pages render by providing React components in a config file

### Backend

- **Store session data** in a simple, flexible array-based format
- **Validate data via schemas**
- **Manage session lifecycle via runs**
- **Track session versions** and prevent incompatible changes after agent updates
- **Expose a clean, stateful API** with streaming
- **Manage agent users and their sessions**
- **Expose a public, read-only API** that can be called directly from the browser
- **Communicate via TypeScript and Python SDKs**

All AgentView configuration lives in code.
