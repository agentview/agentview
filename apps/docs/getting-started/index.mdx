If you're building agents in code (support bots, internal copilots, whatever), you're really doing two completely different jobs:

1. **The AI brain** – prompts, tools, RAG, evals, LangChain/vanilla/whatever.
2. **Everything around it** – session storage, APIs, session viewer, playgrounds for stakeholders, user management, email/slack integrations, etc.

(1) is fun to build. (2) is not. AgentView takes (2) off your plate — all the annoying glue and infra you’d otherwise rebuild for the third time.

### Stack-agnostic by design

Most importantly, AgentView is **framework- and language-agnostic for the AI part**.
Most AI frameworks force you into their hosted backend or they don't have one. AgentView flips that model – it wraps around your AI, not inside it.

You keep full control of the agent logic: write your stateless AI function in Python or TypeScript, using any framework (aisdk, agents-sdk, LangChain, your own) — or **no framework at all**. AgentView just connects to it and handles the sessions, state, and UI around it.


### Studio

- **Browse and inspect real agent sessions**
- **Invite teammates; multi-user by default**
- **Comment, mention, and get notified (Notion-style)**
- **Use a realistic playground**: create private test sessions, share with stakeholders when ready
- **Customize deeply**: define how sessions, cards, inputs, and custom pages render by providing React components in a config file

### Backend

- **Store session data** in a simple, flexible array-based format
- **Validate data via schemas**
- **Manage session lifecycle via runs**
- **Track session versions** and prevent incompatible changes after agent updates
- **Expose a clean, stateful API** with streaming
- **Manage agent users and their sessions**
- **Expose a public, read-only API** that can be called directly from the browser
- **Communicate via TypeScript and Python SDKs**

All AgentView configuration lives in code.  
You focus on how your agent thinks. AgentView handles everything around it.
