## Set up an account

1. Create an account [here](https://agentview.app/signup).
2. Generate development API Key in `API Keys` tab.

## Create a project

Start by creating AgentView project:

```bash
npm create agentview@latest my-agentview-project
```

This will install example project in `my-agentview-project/` dir. Go to the project:

```
cd my-agentview-project
```

It's a simple Vite app with AgentView Studio. All the AgentView configuration is in `agentview.config.tsx` file. The demo Chat Endpoint is in `agent.ts` file.

## Set up environment variables

Before you start, you need to set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - your OpenAI API key (it's needed since demo is using Responses API)
2. `AGENTVIEW_API_KEY` - paste your development API key from the previous step.

## Run Chat Endpoint

Let's run the chat endpoint:

```bash
npm run dev:agent
```

It should be running at `localhost:3000`.

It's a simple Hono HTTP server computing AI responses using OpenAI Responses API and AgentView SDK.

### Test 

Let's test the chat endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST --json '{ "input": { "type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "Hey, my name is Bob." } }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

You should get a response in a following JSON format:

```ts
{
  "id": "SESSION_ID",
  "output": [ /* output items */],
  "token": "USER_TOKEN"
}
```

Let's continue the thread by sending new message (insert `SESSION_ID` and `USER_TOKEN` from the previous response):

```bash
curl -X POST --json '{
    "id": "SESSION_ID",
    "input": {"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "Hello, what was my name again?"},
    "token": "USER_TOKEN"
  }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

You should get a response which shows that the agent remembers your name. AgentView correctly stores the conversation history and remembers the context of the conversation.

Let's send an incorrect input:

```bash
curl -i -X POST --json '{ "input": { "type": "message", "role": "user", "content": 100 } }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

This triggers `422` error, as the input is not a string. AgentView handles the validation and provides a correct HTTP status code.


## Run Studio

Let's run the studio:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:studio
```

Studio should be running at `localhost:1989`.

After you log in you should see the sessions we just created via curl. You can create new sessions from the Studio UI, browse them, comment on them, etc.
