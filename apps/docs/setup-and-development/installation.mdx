## Set up an account

Create an account [here](https://agentview.app/signup).

## Create a project

Start by creating AgentView project:

```bash
npm create agentview@latest my-agentview-project
```

This will install example project in `my-agentview-project/` dir. Go to the project:

```
cd my-agentview-project
```

It's a simple Vite app with AgentView Studio and demo Chat Endpoint in `agent.ts`.

## Set up environment variables

Before you start, you need to set up environment variables. Go to your org Dashboard to the `API Keys` tab and generate a development API key.

Here's what your `.env` file should look like:

1. `VITE_AGENTVIEW_ORGANIZATION_ID` - your organization id, you can find it in Organization Details tab.
2. `AGENTVIEW_API_KEY` - paste your development API key.
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - your OpenAI API key (it's needed since demo is using Responses API)

## Run Chat Endpoint

Let's run the chat endpoint:

```bash
npm run dev:agent
```

It should be running at `localhost:3000`.

It's a simple Hono HTTP server computing AI responses using OpenAI Responses API and AgentView SDK.

### Test 

Let's test the chat endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST --json '{ "input": { "type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "Hey, my name is Bob." } }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

You should get a response in a following JSON format:

```ts
{
  "id": "SESSION_ID",
  "output": [ /* output items */],
  "token": "USER_TOKEN"
}
```

Let's continue the thread by sending new message (insert `SESSION_ID` and `USER_TOKEN` from the previous response):

```bash
curl -X POST --json '{
    "id": "SESSION_ID",
    "input": {"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "Hello, what was my name again?"},
    "token": "USER_TOKEN"
  }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

You should get a response which shows that the agent remembers your name. AgentView correctly stores the conversation history and remembers the context of the conversation.

Let's send an incorrect input:

```bash
curl -i -X POST --json '{ "input": { "type": "message", "role": "user", "content": 100 } }' http://localhost:3000/simple_chat
```

This triggers `422` error, as the input is not a string. AgentView handles the validation and provides a correct HTTP status code.


## Run Studio

Let's run the studio:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:studio
```

Studio should be running at `localhost:1989`.

After you log in you you can:
1. browse sessions, you should see the sessions we just created via curl
2. create new playground sessions
3. invite teammates
4. comment on sessions, mention others, leave like/dislike default scores.
