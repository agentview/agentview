Although the AgentView backend is in the cloud, the Studio and configuration are in your local codebase. This architecture has 2 advantages:
- simple code-first configuration
- since Studio is not "fixed app", but a React package, you can easily customise any part of the experience simply by providing custom React components.

### Studio

Studio is a single page application built in React Router 7 and shipped as an `npm` package.

In our starer example Studio is a simple Vite app run in this way (see `./index.tsx`):

```ts
import "./styles.css";
import { renderStudio } from "agentview";
import agentviewConfig from "./agentview.config";

renderStudio(
    document.getElementById("agentview"), 
    agentviewConfig
);
```

Studio deliberalty doesn't rely on server runtime, it's pure client-side application. Thanks to this it's trivial to build it as a static site and just drop it onto any static hosting.

### Configuration

All the AgentView configuration is in `agentview.config.tsx` file. This file lives in Studio project and must be provided to Studio in `renderStudio(...)`.

All the agent definition information (mostly schemas) is sent to the AgentView Server. Thanks to this Server can do proper validation and prevent incorrect data getting into your system.




Now when you run `npm run dev` in your Studio project, each time `agentview.config.tsx` is changed, it's gonna be synchronised with the Server.

You can also do it manually by running `npx agentview config push` in the Studio project.
