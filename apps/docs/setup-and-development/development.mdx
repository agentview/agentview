## Project Structure

Studio is not a typical fixed SaaS web app hosted on AgentView servers. Instead, it's shipped as an `npm` package, which you can run and host yourself. Thanks to this architecture, you can customise any part of the experience just by providing custom React components in your codebase.  

The starer AgentView project is basically a Vite app with AgentView Studio. The files like `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `index.tsx` etc. are just standard Vite files.

If you look at `index.tsx` file you'll see that it's just a simple call to `renderStudio` function from `@agentview/studio` package:

```ts
import "./styles.css";
import { renderStudio } from "@agentview/studio";
import agentviewConfig from "./agentview.config";

renderStudio(
    document.getElementById("agentview"), 
    agentviewConfig
);
```

Since Studio is just a Vite app, all you need to do to run it is to run:

```bash
npx vite
```

The production build can be done with `npx vite build`.

Under the hood Studio is a React app built with React Router 7 (which is the successor of Remix Run) built in data mode. It doesn't require any server runtime so that it can be run as a static site.

### `agentview.config.tsx`

In the root directory of the Studio project you'll find `agentview.config.tsx` file. It's the main configuration file for AgentView.

As you can see above, the config is passed to the `renderStudio` function, so that Studio is aware of your configuration.

The configuration is also used by AgentView backend. For example, if you provide Zod schemas for your session items, backend will validate the items against the schemas. The config is synced with the backend each time you open the Studio.

**Your local config is never overriding production**. Your local config is bound to your personal Development API Key you use locally. Any call to AgentView API that uses this key will also apply local config. Production uses your Production API Key, so your Production config is always in effect.

### Data storage in local development

Even during local development, no data is ever stored locally, everything is stored in AgentView hosted backend. Since you use your personal Develpoment API Key, the sessions are by default sent to your personal "Playground" space, not visible for other team members. Also, if not explicitly changed, all the versions will be automatically suffixed with `-dev` (e.g. `0.0.1-dev`, `0.0.2-dev`, etc.).

To prevent accidents, development keys can't create sessions in `production` space.

### Chat Endpoint

The starer project comes with a `agent.ts` file. It's a simple Hono HTTP server computing AI responses using OpenAI Responses API and AgentView SDK.

It's important to understand that it's just an example. You can build your API app with Chat Endpoint however you want. Our example uses Hono, but it could be FastAPI Python app, or it could be Typescript built with Vercel functions, etc.

Also, there's no reason it must be in AgentView Studio repository. It could be a totally separate repo. If you use monorepo, you can have Studio and your API app with Chat Endpoint as separate packages.
