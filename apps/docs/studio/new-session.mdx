title: "New Session"
---

Members of your organisation can create new playground sessions by clicking on "Create Session" button. However, your session might require some metadata to be properly created.

You can provide a custom form by setting `newSessionComponent` property:

{ /* <prompt>
  - copy apps/examples/typescript-weather-agent/agentview.config.tsx file into following snippet
  - remove imports, leave only `export default defineConfig({...})` block
  - remove almost everything, leave only `name`, `metadata` and `newSessionComponent` properties so that user understands what's going on.
</prompt> */ }

```tsx
export default defineConfig({
  agents: [
    {
      name: "weather-chat",
      metadata: {
        userLocation: z.string()
      },
      newSessionComponent: ({ submit, isRunning }) => {
        return <div>
          <Input type="text" placeholder="Enter your location" />
          <Button type="submit" disabled={isRunning}>Create Session</Button>
        </div>
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

`submit` function takes 2 properties:

| Prop | Description | Type |
|------|-------------|------|
| `submit` | A function creates new session with proper metadata | `(values: { metadata?: Record<string, any> }) => void` |
| `isRunning` | `true` if session is being created | `boolean` |

When you call it and session is created successfully it will redirect user to the session page.
