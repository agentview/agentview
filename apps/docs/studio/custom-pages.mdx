title: "Custom Pages"
---

You can easily extend Studio with custom pages. You can do it by providing `customRoutes` property:

{ /***
 * <prompt>
  - copy apps/examples/typescript-weather-agent/agentview.config.tsx file into following snippet
  - remove imports, leave only `export default defineConfig({...})` block
  - remove almost everything, leave only `customRoutes` property so that user understands what's going on.
</prompt> */ }

```tsx
export default defineConfig({
  customRoutes: [
    {
      type: "agent",
      agent: "weather-chat",
      title: <><Book className="size-4" /> <span>Custom Page</span></>,
      route: {
        path: "/custom-page",
        Component: CustomPage
      }
    },
    {
      type: "root",
      route: {
        path: "/lorem-ipsum",
        Component: CustomPage
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

There are 2 types of custom routes:
- `root` - these routes are available even if user is not logged in
- `agent` - these routes are available only if user is logged in and is on the agent page
